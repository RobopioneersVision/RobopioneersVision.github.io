<p>GCC supports different dialects of C++, corresponding to the multiple published ISO standards. Which standard it implements can be selected using the <code>-std=</code> command-line option.</p>
<p>For information about the status of C++ defect reports, please see <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-dr-status.html">this page</a>.</p>
<p>For information about the status of the library implementation, please see the  <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/status.html">Implementation Status</a> section of the Libstdc++ manual.</p>
<h2 id="C-20-Support-in-GCC"><a href="#C-20-Support-in-GCC" class="headerlink" title="C++20 Support in GCC"></a>C++20 Support in GCC</h2><p>GCC has experimental support for the latest revision of the C++ standard, which was published in 2020.</p>
<p>C++20 features are available since GCC 8. To enable C++20 support, add the command-line parameter <code>-std=c++20</code> (use <code>-std=c++2a</code> in GCC 9 and earlier) to your <code>g++</code> command line. Or, to enable GNU extensions in addition to C++20 features, add <code>-std=gnu++20</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: Because the ISO C++20 standard is very recent, GCC’s support is <strong>experimental</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="C-20-Language-Features"><a href="#C-20-Language-Features" class="headerlink" title="C++20 Language Features"></a>C++20 Language Features</h2><p>The following table lists new language features that have been accepted into the C++20 working draft. The “Proposal” column provides a link to the ISO C++ committee proposal that describes the feature, while the “Available in GCC?” column indicates the first version of GCC that contains an implementation of this feature (if it has been implemented).</p>
<h2 id="C-17-Support-in-GCC"><a href="#C-17-Support-in-GCC" class="headerlink" title="C++17 Support in GCC"></a>C++17 Support in GCC</h2><p>GCC has almost full support for the previous revision of the C++ standard, which was published in 2017. Some library features are missing or incomplete, as described in <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/status.html#status.iso.2017">the library documentation</a>.</p>
<p>C++17 features are available since GCC 5. This mode is the default in GCC 11; it can be explicitly selected with the <code>-std=c++17</code> command-line flag, or <code>-std=gnu++17</code> to enable GNU extensions as well.</p>
<h2 id="C-17-Language-Features"><a href="#C-17-Language-Features" class="headerlink" title="C++17 Language Features"></a>C++17 Language Features</h2><p>The following table lists new language features that have been accepted into the C++17 working draft. The “Proposal” column provides a link to the ISO C++ committee proposal that describes the feature, while the “Available in GCC?” column indicates the first version of GCC that contains an implementation of this feature (if it has been implemented).</p>
<h2 id="Technical-Specifications"><a href="#Technical-Specifications" class="headerlink" title="Technical Specifications"></a>Technical Specifications</h2><p>GCC also implements experimental support for some language Technical Specifications published by the C++ committee.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: Because these Technical Specifications are still evolving toward future inclusion in a C++ standard, GCC’s support is <strong>experimental</strong>. No attempt will be made to maintain backward compatibility with implementations of features that do not reflect the final standard.</p>
<h2 id="C-14-Support-in-GCC"><a href="#C-14-Support-in-GCC" class="headerlink" title="C++14 Support in GCC"></a>C++14 Support in GCC</h2><p>GCC has full support for the of the 2014 C++ standard.</p>
<p>This mode is the default in GCC 6.1 up until GCC 10 (including); it can be explicitly selected with the <code>-std=c++14</code> command-line flag, or <code>-std=gnu++14</code> to enable GNU extensions as well.</p>
<h2 id="C-14-Language-Features"><a href="#C-14-Language-Features" class="headerlink" title="C++14 Language Features"></a>C++14 Language Features</h2><p>The following table lists new language features that are part of the C++14 standard. The “Proposal” column provides a link to the ISO C++ committee proposal that describes the feature, while the “Available in GCC?” column indicates the first version of GCC that contains an implementation of this feature.</p>
<p>[Untitled](C++ Standards Support in GCC - GNU Project/Untitled Database1.csv)</p>
<p>This feature was briefly part of the C++14 working paper, but was not part of the published standard; as a result, it has been removed from the compiler.</p>
<h2 id="C-11-Support-in-GCC"><a href="#C-11-Support-in-GCC" class="headerlink" title="C++11 Support in GCC"></a>C++11 Support in GCC</h2><p>GCC 4.8.1 was the first feature-complete implementation of the 2011 C++ standard, previously known as C++0x.</p>
<p>This mode can be selected with the <code>-std=c++11</code> command-line flag, or <code>-std=gnu++11</code> to enable GNU extensions as well.</p>
<p>For information about C++11 support in a specific version of GCC, please see:</p>

<h2 id="C-98-Support-in-GCC"><a href="#C-98-Support-in-GCC" class="headerlink" title="C++98 Support in GCC"></a>C++98 Support in GCC</h2><p>GCC has full support for the 1998 C++ standard as modified by the 2003 technical corrigendum and some later defect reports, excluding the <code>export</code> feature which was later removed from the language.</p>
<p>This mode is the default in GCC versions prior to 6.1; it can be explicitly selected with the <code>-std=c++98</code> command-line flag, or <code>-std=gnu++98</code> to enable GNU extensions as well.</p>
